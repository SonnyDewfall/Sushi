## 1. 🟡 Shared understanding — README and manifest

Establish what the project is, how it is shaped, and what is in flight, so the
next session (human or model) can pick it up cold.

- [x] Read the implementation brief and prototype; audit the live environment
- [x] `README.md` — goal, architecture, workflow, layout, environment
- [x] `MANIFEST.md` — this file
- [x] Smoke-tested every tracked config against the real Sushi 1.3.0 — surfaced
      the defects recorded below
- [x] Restructured into a two-zone monorepo: rig at root, tool under `tool/`.
      Split `config/` (patchbay → `Patchbay/`, inventory → `plugin-manifest.txt`,
      leaving only Sushi JSON), and moved the prototype + examples under `tool/`.
      Full package layout (`tool/src/sushi_rig/`, `pyproject.toml`, `tool/tests/`)
      lands with item 2.

**Done when** someone unfamiliar can clone, read the README, and run the rig.

## 2. 🟡 Modelling → config workflow

The core of the project: a stable loop from *tweaking sound by ear* to *a
committed Sushi config*.

Build order (deliberately reordered from the brief's dependency-safe §10 order
to reach a working tweak-by-ear loop as fast as possible — see the plan at
`Project_files` history / chat for the tradeoff discussion):

| Phase | Module | Depends on | Offline-testable |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | environment + package scaffold | — | — |
| B1 | `dump.py` — fix the 1.3.0 trailing-text parse break | — | ✅ |
| B2 | `panel.py` — OSC faders, using `osc_path` verbatim | — | ✅ |
| C1 | `live.py capture` | elkpy | ❌ |
| C2 | `spec.py` — rig.yaml model + validation | PyYAML | ✅ |
| C3 | `emit.py` — spec + state → Sushi JSON | PyYAML | ✅ |
| D | prove the loop on the real rig; fix the 🔴 defect | elkpy | ❌ |
| E1 | `verify.py` | — | ✅ |
| E2 | `probe.py` — LV2 metadata catalogue | lilv | ❌ |
| E3 | config test suite | — | mixed |

A working single-file prototype of all these already exists at
`tool/prototype_reference.py`. Treat it as reference for data shapes and emit logic, not
as the target structure — it is being split into `tool/src/sushi_rig/` with
`pyproject.toml` and `tool/tests/`.

- [x] Environment ready: `python3-pip`, `python3-venv`, `python3-lilv`,
      `lv2-dev`, `lilv-utils`, and `liblilv-dev` installed system-wide (the
      unversioned `liblilv-0.so` symlink lilv's ctypes binding needs ships in
      `liblilv-dev`, not `lv2-dev` — tripped this up initially). `tool/.venv`
      created with `--system-site-packages` so it sees `python3-lilv`; `pyyaml`
      and `elkpy` installed into it and both import cleanly on Python 3.14 —
      the brief's predicted 3.14 risk didn't materialise.
- [x] All open questions from the brief (§7) settled empirically against a live
      Sushi 1.3.0 — see *Open questions* below. Two more elkpy-vs-brief
      mismatches found along the way, on top of the ones already known:
      `create_processor_on_track`'s real argument names, and the correct
      synchronous wait pattern for graph-editing calls. Nothing left blocking
      `live.py`, `probe.py`, or `panel.py`.
- [x] Package scaffold: `tool/pyproject.toml` (src layout, `pytest` dev group,
      `sushi-rig` console script), `tool/src/sushi_rig/`, `tool/tests/`.
      Renamed `tool/sushi_rig.py` → `tool/prototype_reference.py` — its old name
      collided with the new package's import name and, since `tool/` sits on
      `sys.path` at runtime, silently shadowed it. Left in place as reference
      until item 2 phase D deletes it.
- [x] **B1 `dump.py`** — fixed break, parses with `JSONDecoder().raw_decode`
      from the first `{`, ignoring the trailing `Parameter dump completed -
      exiting.` line. `collect_parameter_info` added alongside the prototype's
      `collect_parameter_names`, keeping each parameter's full record
      (`osc_path` included) rather than just its name.
- [x] **B2 `panel.py`** — rebuilt to use each parameter's `osc_path` from the
      dump verbatim instead of constructing one from the name.
- [x] **B2 revisited: `panel.py`'s session schema verified against real
      open-stage-control 1.31.1**, not just against the brief's description.
      Installed it (`.deb` from openstagecontrol.ammd.net — apt/snap don't
      package it; note its `_apt` sandbox needs the `.deb` somewhere
      world-traversable, `$HOME` at `750` blocks it, copy to `/tmp` first),
      then actually loaded generated panels into it and watched them render.
      Two real defects found this way, neither visible from reading docs:
      - `sendPort` on the root object **is not a real property** — the
        prototype invented it. The actual send target is set via
        open-stage-control's own `--send ip:port` CLI flag at launch.
        Removed; `cli.py panel` now prints the matching launch command
        instead.
      - `layout: "grid"` on a container **collapses every fader inside it to
        a sliver** — confirmed by isolating one fader (renders correctly at
        its set height alone) against the same fader inside a grid container
        (collapses to near-nothing). Switched to plain flow layout (`layout`
        left unset — `"default"` is already open-stage-control's own
        default), which was confirmed to wrap same-sized widgets correctly
        at full height.
      Final result — generated from the live `acoustic_chorus_fx.json` dump,
      loaded into real open-stage-control, all 4 tabs and all faders
      rendered and were confirmed draggable (watched a handle move on drag).
- [x] 13 offline tests passing (`cd tool && source .venv/bin/activate && pytest`),
      run against the real `dump.example.json` fixture plus a synthetic
      differently-nested one for the generic-walk claim.
- [x] **C1 `live.py capture`** — fixed a real API break found only by running
      it: `AudioGraphController` has no `get_tracks` in elkpy 1.2.0, the real
      method is `get_all_tracks()`. Also fixed a second, more consequential
      bug: `capture` was pulling in every parameter Sushi reports, including
      non-automatable (read-only) ones like `"Latency OUT"` and the various
      `*_meter`/`*_visibility` params — baking one of those into
      `initial_state` makes Sushi **refuse to load the config at all**
      (exit 7, not a silent no-op). `capture` now filters on
      `ParameterInfo.automatable`. `push()` also written (kwarg-name fixes
      from the earlier session, plus the `.is_set()` poll loop), though the
      chosen workflow (launch Sushi on a full config, tweak, capture, emit)
      doesn't require it for the core loop.
- [x] **C2 `spec.py`, C3 `emit.py`** — ported and tested; 36 offline tests
      passing in total.
- [x] **A schema bug bigger than anything found so far**: `initial_state`'s
      `parameters` and `properties` are **dicts** of `{name: value}`, not a
      list of `{"name", "value"}` objects. Both the brief §2.4's own example
      and the prototype used the list form — confirmed wrong against Sushi's
      *own* shipped example configs (extracted from inside the AppImage,
      `usr/share/config_files/*.json`, five different files, unanimous). The
      list form doesn't error loudly on its own shape; it fails with the same
      "Failed to load the initial processor states." Sushi gives for a
      genuinely bad parameter name, which is what made this take real
      bisection to find rather than a quick read of an error message. Fixed
      in `emit.py`.
- [x] **The full loop proven against a live Sushi 1.3.0**, not just unit
      tested: `emit` → config loads → `capture` → `emit` with real captured
      state → **that config also loads**, with the captured values actually
      applied on startup (set `Ratio` to a deliberately non-default `0.9`
      normalised, restarted Sushi from the baked config, read back `0.9`
      normalised / `90.1` real-world — matching `1 + 0.9×99` on the `[1,100]`
      domain exactly).

**Future direction for phase D:** the tweak-by-ear step currently runs as an
interactive session — launch Sushi, open Open Stage Control, tweak, then a
person (or Claude) manually runs `sushi-rig capture` at the point the sound is
right. That's fine for now, but it's not something a script can repeat
unattended, and it puts a Claude Code session in the loop every time a config
needs re-tuning.

The direction to move in later: a deterministic tool that captures state
directly from an Open Stage Control action — e.g. a "save" button in the panel
that fires an OSC message the tool listens for, or a small always-running
listener that snapshots on request — rather than a human deciding when to run
`capture` from a terminal. Not scoped or built yet; revisit once the loop above
has been used for real a few times and it's clear what "capture now" should
actually be triggered by.

---

## 3. ⚪ Headless runs and a config test suite

Every config in `config/` should be provably loadable without plugging in a
guitar, so edits can be made with confidence.

- Smoke test: `sushi --dump-plugins -c <config>` over every tracked config —
  exercises the full load path, needs no audio hardware, exits immediately
- `verify` over any config carrying `initial_state`, to catch parameter-name
  drift
- Offline render regression: `sushi -o -i input.wav -c rig.json`, hashing the
  output. A short committed input file makes this a cheap guard against silent
  parameter drift
- Unit tests per brief §8, driven from committed fixtures — priority order is
  spec validation, emit, dump parsing, verify, panel

- [x] Real `--dump-plugins` output captured as `tool/examples/dump.example.json` —
      the brief's highest-value offline fixture. Everything in the offline group
      can be tested against it.

The smoke test is available today and needs no new dependencies:

```bash
export LV2_PATH="$HOME/Sushi/plugins/lv2:$HOME/Sushi/plugins:/usr/lib/lv2"
for c in config/*.json; do ./sushi --dump-plugins -c "$c" >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  && echo "ok   $c" || echo "FAIL $c"; done
```

Worth wiring up first — it is what surfaced the defects below.

---

## 4. 🟡 Config library structure and versioning

- [x] Physically separated the kinds of file that were mixed in `config/`:
      patchbay routing → `Patchbay/`, plugin inventory → `plugin-manifest.txt`,
      leaving `config/` holding only Sushi JSON configs.
- [x] Naming and versioning convention agreed (below). Applying it to the four
      existing configs happens in item 2, phase D.

### Naming

Shared `<instrument>_<character>` stem across the hand-authored source, the
deployable config, and any archived snapshot:

```
config/src/acoustic_chorus.yaml            hand-authored source
config/acoustic_chorus.json                emitted, deployable — what start-rig.sh loads
config/archive/acoustic_chorus/v1.2.json   frozen snapshot
```

Utility/test configs get a `test_` prefix (`test_passthrough.json`, currently
`empty.json`). Live configs drop the redundant `_fx` suffix
(`acoustic_chorus_fx.json` → `acoustic_chorus.json`).

### Versioning — three layers, each doing a different job

1. **Git** is the version of record for the project and for every change to a
   sound. Live config *filenames* stay stable forever — `start-rig.sh` never
   needs editing on a tonal change, and `git diff` on the JSON is exactly how
   parameter drift becomes visible.
2. **`MAJOR.MINOR` in a metadata header**, so a config self-identifies without
   consulting git log: **MAJOR** bumps when the plugin chain changes (added,
   removed, reordered); **MINOR** bumps when only parameter values changed.
3. **`config/archive/<name>/v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.json`** — a deliberate, named
   snapshot taken when a tone is worth keeping before moving on. Since the
   emitted JSON carries the full chain plus `initial_state`, an archived file
   alone reproduces that exact tone.

### Metadata header

A top-level `_meta` block — confirmed empirically that Sushi 1.3.0 tolerates an
unrecognised top-level key (exit 0, no schema complaint). Only stable fields;
deliberately no timestamp or commit hash, which would diff on every emit and
defeat layer 1:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "name": "acoustic_chorus",
    "version": "1.2",
    "source": "config/src/acoustic_chorus.yaml",
    "description": "Acoustic guitar — compressor, EQ, chorus, light reverb",
    "status": "wip"
  },
  "host_config": { ... }
}
```

Archived copies additionally carry `archived_at`. `emit` copies `_meta` through
verbatim from the YAML source; nothing bumps the version automatically — that's
a deliberate act when a change is worth calling MAJOR or MINOR.

Sources live at `config/src/<name>.yaml` — separate from the generated JSON
they produce, sharing a stem so the pairing is obvious, without changing where
`start-rig.sh` looks for the configs it loads.

---

## 5. ⚪ Portability to other machines

The rig currently hard-codes `$HOME/Sushi` and depends on an untracked 358 MB
`plugins/` directory copied from the system LV2 install.

- Derive paths from the script location rather than `$HOME`
- Reconstruct `plugins/` from `plugin-manifest.txt` plus a package
  install, rather than by copying binaries
- Capture a plugin catalogue per machine and diff them — brief §5.3 exists
  specifically to catch version drift between the authoring machine and the
  target before it produces a wrong-sounding rig

---

## 6. 🔵 Grow the rig

Ongoing, once the loop above is stable: more plugins, more tracks, other
instruments.

Constraint worth knowing up front: **Sushi does not support the LV2 `patch:`
extension.** Any plugin whose state lives outside control ports — convolution
reverbs, sample players, sfz loaders, anything taking a file path — cannot be
configured from a JSON config at all. `probe` should flag these, because
discovering it late changes the shape of the rig.

---

## Open questions

Blocking item 2, steps 4–6. Each has a command that settles it; none should be
guessed.

### Settled

**Sushi names LV2 parameters from `lv2:name`, not the port symbol.** Spaces and
capitalisation are preserved verbatim — `"Attack threshold"`, `"Band gain 1.6K"`,
`"Show pre-mix overlay"`. No symbol-to-name mapping layer is needed. Internal
plugins differ from LV2 in that `name` and `label` diverge (Freeverb reports
name `room_size`, label `Room Size`); for LV2 the two were identical throughout.
*(2026-09-13, via `--dump-plugins` on Sushi 1.3.0.)*

**`--dump-plugins` output shape on 1.3.0** is `{"plugins": [{name, label,
parameters: [{name, label, osc_path, id}]}]}` — followed on **stdout** by the
literal line `Parameter dump completed - exiting.`. Captured verbatim as
`tool/examples/dump.example.json`.

> ⚠️ This breaks the prototype. `sushi_rig.py:dump_plugins()` handles *leading*
> log lines but not a *trailing* message, so both `json.loads` paths raise
> `Extra data`. `verify` and `panel` cannot work on 1.3.0 until it parses with
> `JSONDecoder().raw_decode()` from the first `{`. First thing to fix in item 2.

**`osc_path` is provided per parameter**, with spaces replaced by underscores
(`/parameter/compressor_mono/Show_pre-mix_overlay`). `panel.py` must use these
verbatim rather than constructing paths from names — the prototype constructs
them and would produce addresses that never match.

**`get_parameter_value` is normalised; `get_parameter_value_in_domain` is
real-world.** elkpy's own docstring on `get_parameter_value_in_domain` claims it
returns "the normalised value" — that is backwards. Proven against a live Sushi
1.3.0 (dummy frontend, `compressor_mono`'s `Ratio`, domain `[1.0, 100.0]`):
`get_parameter_value` returned `0.030303`, `get_parameter_value_in_domain`
returned `4.0`, and `get_parameter_value_as_string` agreed (`"4.000000"`). The
`sushi_rpc.proto` message `ParameterInfo` carries `min_domain_value` /
`max_domain_value`, confirming "domain" means real-world plugin units.
`capture` must use `get_parameter_value` — which is what the prototype already
does; this was a risk in the prototype's design, not a bug in it.
*(2026-09-13, elkpy on Sushi API 1.2.0.)*

**Sushi ignores the LV2 `pprops:logarithmic` hint and normalises every control
port linearly against `[min, max]`.** Checked four log-tagged ports on the real
compressor (`Ratio` 1–100, `Attack time` 0–2000, `High-pass filter frequency`
10–20000, `Knee` 0.063–1.0) — in every case, measured normalised value equalled
`(domain_value − min) / (max − min)` to 4+ decimal places. `probe.py`'s planned
warning-not-guess stance for logarithmic ports (brief §2.3) can be relaxed: the
existing linear `normalise()` helper in the prototype is correct as-is, no
special-casing needed. *(2026-09-13, empirical, same session as above.)*

**Toggled ports are exposed as ordinary `FLOAT` parameters** (`ParameterType.FLOAT
= 3`, not a distinct `BOOL`), domain `[0, 1]`, normalisation therefore identity.
Confirmed on `compressor_mono`'s `Enabled`. Not exposed as a two-value
enumeration — the brief's suspicion was unfounded. *(2026-09-13)*

**`create_processor_on_track`'s real signature** (this elkpy version, source-read
in `audiographcontroller.py:525`):

```python
create_processor_on_track(name, uid, path, processor_type, track_id, before_processor, add_to_back)
```

Two argument names differ from the prototype's call: `processor_type` (not
`plugin_type`) and `before_processor` (not `before_processor_id`) — the
prototype's `push()` would raise `TypeError` immediately. `PluginType` enum
members (`INTERNAL`, `LV2`, `VST2X`, `VST3X`) do match what the prototype
assumes. *(2026-09-13)*

**Graph-editing calls return a `SushiCommandResponse` (an `asyncio.Event`
subclass with `.id`, `.error`, `.result`), not the brief's `ElkpyEvent` shape
(`.sushi_id`, `.data`, `.params`)** — API drift between elkpy versions, exactly
as §2.8 warned. Its own docstring is explicit about the sync-context contract:
*"await it in an asynchronous program, or check `.is_set()` on it in a
[synchronous one]"*. The prototype's `_wait()` helper calls `.wait()` directly
and, on seeing an awaitable back, just returns — it never actually blocks in
sync code, so `push()` races exactly as brief §2.8 warned it might. `live.py`
needs a real poll loop on `.is_set()` with a timeout. *(2026-09-13, source-read
+ docstring)*

All open questions from the brief are now settled. No more empirical checks
block `live.py`, `probe.py`, or `panel.py`.

---

## Known defects

### 🔴 The plugin settings in both acoustic configs do nothing

Affects `config/acoustic_reverb_fx.json` and `config/acoustic_chorus_fx.json`
— every `properties` block in `config/` is of this form.


Both plugins carry a `properties` block *inside the plugin entry*, holding
real-world values:

```json
{ "name": "compressor_mono", "type": "lv2",
  "properties": { "Attack threshold": -30.0, "Ratio": 4.0, "Knee": -6.00 } }
```

That is not a mechanism Sushi implements. Startup parameter values belong in a
**top-level `initial_state` array**, and every value must be **normalised
0.0–1.0** — `-30.0 dB` is not a value Sushi can interpret.

Proven, not inferred: replacing the block with a fabricated parameter name
(`"Totally Fake Parameter": 999999.0`) still exits **0**, while the same
fabricated name inside `initial_state` exits **7**. `initial_state` is
validated; `properties` here is silently discarded.

The parameter *names* are all correct and do exist on the plugins — only the
placement and the value domain are wrong. This is exactly the "loads cleanly,
sounds wrong" failure the whole project exists to prevent, and it is sitting in
the rig that `start-rig.sh` launches today.

**No longer blocked.** The linear-normalisation finding above means every
value here can now be computed directly from each port's domain (from `probe`,
or read live via `get_parameter_value_in_domain`), without the caution the
brief urged around logarithmic ports. Fixing the two live configs — replacing
the bogus `properties` block with a real, correctly-shaped `initial_state` —
happens in item 2 phase D, using the now-working `capture`/`emit` loop.

### 🟠 `start-rig.sh` does not put the bundled plugins on `LV2_PATH`

The script sets `LV2_PATH="$HOME/Sushi/plugins:…"`, but `LV2_PATH` entries must
be directories *containing* `.lv2` bundles. Only `plugins/lsp-plugins.lv2` sits
at that level. The 262 bundles in `plugins/lv2/` are never seen — lilv treats
`plugins/lv2` as a single malformed bundle and logs
`Error reading …/plugins/lv2/manifest.ttl` on every launch.

The rig works anyway, because the fallback `/usr/lib/lv2` is also on the path —
which means the "portable plugins directory" is not actually supplying anything
except the newer LSP build. Relevant to item 5: portability here is currently
illusory.

### 🟠 Two LSP versions are installed simultaneously

`plugins/lsp-plugins.lv2` is v0.26; `plugins/lv2/lsp-plugins.lv2` and
`/usr/lib/lv2/lsp-plugins.lv2` are v0.22. lilv resolves this by silently
preferring 0.26. Which build a config resolves against therefore depends on
`LV2_PATH` ordering — precisely the version drift the catalogue diff in item 5
is meant to catch.

Also note `plugins/lv2/` is a byte-identical copy of `/usr/lib/lv2/` (262 of
262 bundles, no extras either way), so it is ~358 MB of pure redundancy that is
shadowed on the current path anyway.

### 🟡 Sushi requires `LV2_PATH` to be set explicitly

With `LV2_PATH` unset, Sushi loads no LV2 plugins at all and exits 4
(`Failed to load tracks from the Json config file`) — even though `lv2ls` finds
648 plugins using lilv's built-in defaults. Running `./sushi -c <config>` by
hand, outside `start-rig.sh`, fails for this reason and the error does not
mention `LV2_PATH`.

---

## Decisions

**Plugin binaries are not tracked in git.** `plugins/` is an exact copy of
`/usr/lib/lv2` (262 of 262 bundles). Tracking it meant ~358 MB of third-party
GPL binaries in a public repo, reproducible from a package manager in seconds.
Configs address plugins by URI, so `plugin-manifest.txt` is the artefact
worth versioning. *(2026-09-13 — purged from history; repo went from 141 MB to
under 1 MB.)*

**One monorepo, two zones — not two repos.** The rig (personal, machine-specific
configs and scripts, at the root) and the tool (reusable config-generating
software, under `tool/`) are separate concerns but share one workflow, so they
share one repo while this is a personal project. If the tool needs to be
operationalised independently later, it can be split out then. *(2026-09-13)*

**Open Stage Control, not a bespoke web GUI.** Generated OSC fader panels close
the loop with far less code and match the brief. A custom UI — and any
patchbay-style graph view — is deferred until the workflow is proven.
*(2026-09-13)*

**Sushi is the authoring host, not just the deployment target.** Rejected
converting from a desktop host session format; see README for the three
compounding reasons. *(Pre-dates this repo — from the implementation brief.)*
