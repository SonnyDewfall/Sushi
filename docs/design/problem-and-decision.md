# The problem, and the architectural decision

## The problem this solves

Sushi's config format is a poor authoring surface. Plugin parameters are
addressed **by the name Sushi assigns them** — derived from the plugin's TTL
metadata, not necessarily the port symbol — and every value is **normalised to
0.0–1.0** regardless of the plugin's real units. A reverb decay of 2.4 seconds
appears in the file as `0.32`.

For one plugin that is merely awkward. For a 10–30 plugin chain it is
unworkable: the file cannot be read, reviewed or corrected by eye, and a wrong
value produces a config that loads cleanly and sounds wrong.

## The architectural decision

**Sushi is both the deployment target and the authoring host.**

The obvious alternative — dial the sound in using a desktop host like Carla or
Ardour, then convert the session file to Sushi JSON — was considered and
rejected. It fails three ways at once:

| | Desktop host | Sushi |
|---|---|---|
| Parameter addressing | port symbol (`gain`) | Sushi's assigned name (`Gain`) |
| Parameter values | real-world (`-12.0 dB`) | normalised (`0.35`) |
| Version drift | silent — renamed ports still "work" | caught by Sushi's own introspection |

Each gap needs a translation layer, and both layers break silently when a plugin
updates. Authoring inside Sushi removes them entirely: the values read back are
already normalised and already named the way Sushi names them, because the same
wrapper code produced both.

The cost: Sushi is headless, so plugins' own GUIs are unavailable. That was an
accepted trade-off when scoping the project. In v1, parameters were tweaked
through generated [Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/)
faders instead; that panel still runs ([the v1 workflow](../reference/v1-workflow.md)),
but the rig is now driven from the web UI the agent serves
([user guides](../guide/README.md), [the web UI](../reference/web-ui.md)).
